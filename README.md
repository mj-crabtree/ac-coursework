# Algorithms & Collections Coursework, Spring '22

## Overview
An inventory management proof of concept web application built with Spring MVC for (and alongside) a [small business](https://hoyfc.com/) focusing on: 
- sensible, clear UX,
- the appropriate use of custom algorithms and collections,
- employing enterprise design patterns in an attempt to implement clean architecture.
 
In addition to the code two pieces of documentation and a video were supplied comprising a project proposal, reflection and justifications, and a [guided tour](https://youtu.be/0xVSSKTvujg) of the application.

## Feedback

> - In general, the documentation is outstanding. The report (33/40) content is outstanding, but could have included the UML use case diagram and explanations of the Professional, Social, Ethical, and Legal aspects of the project. 
> - The code (48/50) is of an outstanding quality.
> - The video (9/10) has an excellent content and is very well presented, but the video could have been shorter.
